                <h1>USF Student Simulator</h1>
                <p>Introducing the USF Student Simulator, a fun parody game experience that lets you step into the shoes of a University of San Francisco student. This interactive simulation, hosted on a user-friendly website, invites players to step into the shoes of a University of San Francisco student and navigate through the campus challenges in three silly games. This was coded in HTML, CSS, and p5.js.</p>

                <h1>Possum Ex Libris</h1>
                <p>For this Ex Libris, I wanted to create a design that reflected my personality and interests. I chose to feature a possum holding a pencil, as possums are intelligent and adaptable creatures, and the pencil symbolizes my love for creativity and self-expression. The star sunglasses add a fun and playful touch and represent my love for the unconventional and the unexpected.<br><br>This design is a playful and unique representation of who I am as a designer.</p>

                <h1>Video Game Concept Covers</h1>
                <p>As a graphic designer with a passion for video games, I created a series of concept covers for a hypothetical career-themed video game. Each cover features a unique visual style and typography and highlights a different career, such as an architect, a comedian, or even an exorcist.<br><br>These covers showcase my ability to conceptualize and design visually appealing graphics that capture the essence of a particular profession.</p>

                <h1>Nature Typography Series</h1>
                <p>For this design project, I created a series of posters that depict signs that have interacted with nature on campus, showcasing the resilience of nature despite the destruction caused by humans. The typography in these posters is meant to be foreboding, representing the destructive aspects of humanity and the inevitability of nature continuing with or without us.<br><br>These posters are meant to be a reminder of the power and beauty of nature, and the fragility of humanity.</p>

            <h1>Architecture Illustration</h1>
               <p>For this project, I combined my love of architecture and illustration to create a series of limited color palette illustrations featuring iconic buildings on my college campus. I photographed each building as reference and used those photos to create detailed, accurate illustrations that capture the unique character of each structure.<br><br>Working within a limited color palette allowed me to focus on composition and form, and the result is a cohesive series of illustrations that showcase my attention to detail and ability to capture the essence of a building.</p>

                <h1>Black Student Union Shirt</h1>
               <p>For this design project, I created a 70s-inspired Bratz-themed design for the Black Student Union to use on merchandise, such as a tote bag. The design features vibrant colors and a retro aesthetic that captures the fun and playful nature of the Bratz brand. I carefully chose the layout, typography, and color scheme to create an eye-catching and impactful design that would appeal to fans of the Bratz brand and the Black Student Union.</p>
